My first project using machine learning was an attempt to beat mario using reinforcement learning. I completed a few kaggle lessons prior and used some youtube videos for the setup and was able to get a working version after a lot of trouble shooting and bug fixing, while I never figured how to render the final versions, I was able to make the program adapt and improve and with enough time beat mario.
