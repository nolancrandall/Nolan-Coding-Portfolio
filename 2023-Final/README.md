My final project in Honors Coding and Computer Science was also a portfolio that showcased some of my projects. I created my own Connect 4 game and improved my shooting star project from earlier and connected them with an interface that switches between the two. This project was much different than anything I had coded before at the time, and I learned a lot of new techniques such as using scenes and transparent objects. If I were to improve the project now, I would have made the code more concise, and possibly added more projects
